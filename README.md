# Zillow Clone - React.JS Application

This is a recreation of Zillow's popular real estate listing website. 

### Motivation

Real Estate is one of the many interests that I have. I wanted to take on the challenge of recreating a website on my own and to simulate what it'd be like if I were given a set of instructions/vision to create a website for a company. I was particularly interested in what it'd take to integrate data received back from a listing API and to use that with the markers capability of Google's Map API after using Zillow's website and other real estate listing websites on my own in the past.

### Build Status

As of 8/25/2022:

- Google Maps API has been integrated in the buy section of the site
- future updates will be integrating [Datafiniti's](https://datafiniti.co/products/property-data/) Property Data API to interact with listings and markers through the data received back integrated into the Google Maps API
  - originally wanted to use Zillow's own search results API but it is [no longer operational](https://www.zillow.com/webservice/GetSearchResults.htm)
- build out search capabilities in the search bar on the front page once [Datafiniti's](https://datafiniti.co/products/property-data/) Property Data API is integrated

### Technologies Used

Web Development: React.JS, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Reactstrap, Google Maps API

### How to Use Zillow Clone

Upon loading the website, you can interact with the elements on the page that are similar to Zillow's site. The top navbar elements boast active elements for routes that have been built out. Inactive elements are disabled.
